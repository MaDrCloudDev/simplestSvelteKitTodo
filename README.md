# [simplestSvelteKitTodo](http://simplestsveltekittodo.madr.io/)

After writing my [simplestJsTodo](http://simplestjstodo.madr.io/), I couldn't help but write a bunch of todo apps in other languages as part of a series.

This series of "simplestTodoApps" has been less than simple. The second I finish the functionality, my instinct's to center the app vertically and horizontally. To make the app symmetrical. I want to make it so you can click the "todo text" to check a todo, and not just the checkbox itself. I feel impelled to fix all the a11y errors. To make the app dark-themed. I end up adding so much CSS that it's no longer simple and I'd be better off adding Tailwind; but adding a dependency isn't exactly simple either? So I'm doing my best to rewrite it and scale it back.

```
npm install
npm dev
npm build
```
